I had a great opportunity to talk about Ansible for zSystems on a live streamed Red Hat webcast called the GitOps Guide to the Galaxy alongside our Senior Go To Market Product Manager Dan Jast. It was such a fun time chatting with Red Hatters Hilliary Lipsig and Christian Hernandez about why the mainframe is still the platform of choice and backbone for mission critical workloads and what we're doing to standardize the automation experience for the mainframe with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and Red Hat OpenShift. Check out the replay below on your streaming platform of choice and feel free to drop a comment with your thoughts about the mainframe or what we're doing with Ansible.
